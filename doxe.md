Howdy, I'm Alex, aka @doxe experienced web3 enthusiast, contributor, moderator and professional validator, also just a friendly person

My main vision and goal is to help newbies and make their acquaintance with crypto easier, that's why I write guides, most of it is in English, but I also actively support Ukrainian and Russian languages. I'm creating or supporting English/Ukrainian/Russian thematic chats as administrator, where I'm helping participants with the same geeks.

Overall, it's been going on for about 2 years, I'm very excited and passionate about it.

I actively participate in testnets of young networks, sometimes even become a genesis validator in mainnets.
