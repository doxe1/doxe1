Howdy, I'm Alex, aka **@doxe** experienced web3 enthusiast, contributor, moderator and PoS/PoW validator, also just a friendly person

Some info about me - deep passion for web3 and decentralization. 2+ years in the crypto space with strong knowledge and use of DeFi dApps, L1/L2 blockchains and yield farming strategies. I thrive on daily ingestion of new developments in web3, including DeFi, community engagement and problem solving. Contributor, detail-oriented with a curious mind. What keeps me engaged is the fact that I learn something new every single day.

My main vision and goal is to help newbies and make their acquaintance with crypto easier, that's why I write guides, most of it is in English, but I also actively support Ukrainian and Russian languages. I'm creating or supporting English/Ukrainian/Russian thematic chats as administrator, where I'm helping participants with the same geeks.

Overall, it's been going on for about 2 years, I'm very excited and passionate about it. I pay close attention to each of my validators, I support them both with my time, 24 hours a day, as well as using programs and more for monitoring, namely - Grafana + Prometeus + Telegram alerts. Maintaining a healthy validator is one of my major goals.

I actively participate in testnets of young networks, sometimes even become a genesis validator in mainnets. Networks: https://github.com/doxe1/doxe1/blob/main/doxe.md
