Howdy, I'm Alex, aka **@doxe** experienced web3 enthusiast, contributor, moderator and PoS/PoW validator, also just a friendly person.

Some info about me - deep passion for web3 and decentralization. 2+ years in the crypto space with strong knowledge and use of DeFi dApps, L1/L2 blockchains and yield farming strategies. I thrive on daily ingestion of new developments in web3, including DeFi, community engagement and problem solving. Contributor, detail-oriented with a curious mind. What keeps me engaged is the fact that I learn something new every single day.

## Goal and vision

In general, my main goal and vision is to help newbies and make their acquaintance with the world of crypto and tesnets in general easier, for this purpose I support guides for different projects in which I am involved or at people's request. At this stage, I write them in English, as I consider this language the most important one for understanding in web3. Also, **I support Ukrainian, as it's my native language**, and I understand Russian at the advance level. I often initiate the creation of **thematic chats in telegram or other social networks to support people in the local language**. There, together with other participants, I try to maintain interesting communication and help each other in case of any questions, issues and etc.

All in all, I've been doing this for **about 1 year**, and am very happy and favourable about it. I keep a close eye on each of my validators and responsibly monitor their **health, security, updates** and other parameters to ensure that they function **consistently and correctly** on the server. Below we go over the main parameters:

## Safety precautions

- Removed the default SSH port 22 and are using another port for SSH.
- Removed SSH login using root password (root-pass).
- Fail2ban - SSH login is only allowed from 1 main IP and temporary access to another IP is allowed during travel.
- Run dedicated powerful servers for all our nodes with NVMe SSD. A few settings have been specially updated for the best performance on the server. We regularly check and update for new updates for the operating system.
- Storing all private files in multiple secure locations.
- Storing and sending requests to the server, from the local machine, using binary files.

## Networks

I actively participate in testnets of young networks, sometimes even become a genesis validator in mainnets. My list of [networks](https://github.com/doxe1/doxe1/blob/main/doxe.md).
